# DESCRIPTION OF TASK LIKE HOW YOU PERFORMED AND WHAT YOU HAVE DONE AND PASTE PICTURES OF OUTPUT:
For the final task, I performed sentiment analysis on textual data such as product reviews and tweets. The pipeline included data preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, and vectorization using TF-IDF). I then implemented a classification model using Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression to classify the sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. The model was trained and tested with evaluation metrics like accuracy and F1-score. I also visualized the most frequent keywords and generated a word cloud to highlight common sentiments.
